# Description
A website built using the MVC architecture with HTML, PHP, CSS (utilizing the Bootstrap library), and JavaScript. The project structure is neatly divided into modules following the MVC pattern, with each page having its own Model, Controller, and View. Interaction with the database is handled via MySQL. There are three available roles: a seller, who can list items for sale; a buyer, who can create a cart and place orders; and an administrator.
